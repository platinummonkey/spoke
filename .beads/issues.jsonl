{"id":"spoke-yus","title":"[P1] Consolidate 4 different Storage interfaces","description":"## Problem\nFound 4 different Storage interfaces across packages:\n1. pkg/api/types.go:123 - `Storage` interface\n2. pkg/storage/interfaces.go:12 - `StorageV2` interface  \n3. pkg/search/indexer.go:21 - `StorageReader` interface\n4. pkg/marketplace/storage.go:9 - `Storage` interface\n\n## Impact\n- Unclear which interface to implement\n- Forces adapter proliferation\n- Breaks interface segregation\n- Difficult to add storage backends\n- Only 2 files import pkg/api (suggests package isolation issues)\n\n## Evidence\n- grep shows 4 distinct Storage interface definitions\n- PostgresStorage implements both Storage and StorageV2\n- Migration incomplete with 8 TODOs in postgres.go\n\n## Recommended Fix\n1. Define single canonical interface in pkg/storage/interfaces.go\n2. Use interface composition for specialized needs:\n   - StorageReader (read-only operations)\n   - StorageWriter (write operations)\n   - StorageAdmin (admin operations)\n3. Deprecate old interfaces\n4. Migrate all implementations to new structure\n\n## Estimated Effort\nL (Large) - 3-4 days","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"cody.lee@datadoghq.com","created_at":"2026-01-27T08:25:18.38716-06:00","created_by":"Cody Lee","updated_at":"2026-01-27T08:25:18.38716-06:00"}
